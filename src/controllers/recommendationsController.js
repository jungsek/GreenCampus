Based on the data summary below and considering Singapore's national climate target to achieve "net zero emissions by 2050" as part of our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS), generate a comprehensive sustainability analysis. This analysis should include:

1. **Green Score:** Assign a score out of 100 indicating the school's sustainability performance. A score of 90 and above is excellent, showing proximity to achieving Net Zero Emissions. Provide a short summary explaining the reasoning behind the score.

2. **Areas of Concern:** Identify key areas that need improvement, such as the month with the highest emissions or the location with the highest energy consumption. For each area of concern:
   - Highlight the problem.
   - Display the relevant data.
   - Provide a conclusion, reasoning, and in-depth explanation of the factors contributing to this concern.
   - Talk about the months, periods, and locations where the issue is most prominent.

3. **Personalized Recommendations:** Offer specific, actionable recommendations to address each area of concern. Ensure that the recommendations are task-specific, personalized to the school's context, and include explanations for their effectiveness.

4. **Strengths:** Highlight areas where the school performed well, such as months with the lowest emissions or effective energy management in certain locations. For each strength:
   - Highlight the achievement.
   - Display the relevant data.
   - Provide a conclusion and in-depth explanation of why this is a strength.

5. **Path to Net Zero:** Outline how the school can achieve net-zero emissions, including sustainable practices to be adopted, strategies for measurable reductions, and methods for tracking progress toward sustainability goals.
