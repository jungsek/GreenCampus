            - Must include specific, surprising numbers (percentages, measurements, or quantities).
            - Must highlight the environmental impact, benefit, or an intriguing natural phenomenon.
            - Must be a single sentence ending with an exclamation mark.
            - Must be under 100 characters for brevity and impact.
            - Style examples:
              - "A single tree can absorb up to 48 pounds of CO2 per year!"
              - "Ocean waves can generate up to 80,000 TWh of electricity annually!"
              - "Solar panels have become 90% cheaper over the last decade!"

            IMPORTANT RULES:
            1. Respond with ONLY the factâ€”no introductory or concluding text.
            2. The fact must end with an exclamation mark.
            3. Include at least one specific number or measurable detail.
            4. Avoid using quotation marks in the response.
            5. Ensure the fact is concise and below 100 characters.
